## Features

This sample illustrates the following concepts:

* Using variables to store information about Azure OpenAI service parameters for easy and straightforward parameter management
* Creating POST request to Azure OpenAI service to get information
* API response configuration to use received data in the future actions (flows, apps, etc.)

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription
* Azure OpenAI resource created
* A model deployed using Azure OpenAI
* Saved Azure OpenAI service and model parameters

Follow below steps to create an Azure OpenAI resource and deploy a model in advance.

### Create Azure OpenAI resource

*Currently, access to Azure OpenAI service is granted only by application. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI by completing the form at [https://aka.ms/oai/access](https://aka.ms/oai/access).*

1. In the browser open the page to create [Azure OpenAI service](https://portal.azure.com/?microsoft_azure_marketplace_ItemHideKey=microsoft_openai_tip#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesOpenAI) and login with your credentials
2. On the `Basics` page provide information described bellow and click `Next` button
* `Subscription`: Select the Azure subscription used in your OpenAI onboarding application
* `Resource group`: The Azure resource group that will contain your OpenAI resource. You can create a new group or add it to a pre-existing group.
* `Region`: The location of your instance. Different locations may introduce latency, but have no impact on the runtime availability of your resource.
* `Name`: A descriptive name for your cognitive services resource. For example, MyOpenAIResource.
* `Pricing Tier`: Only 1 pricing tier is available for the service currently

3. On the `Tags` screen click the `Next` button
4. On the `Review + submit` screen click the `Create` button

### Deploy a model
1. Open the Azure OpenAI resource created in the previous step
2. Go to the `Model deployments` tab and click the `Create` button
3. Provide information about the model you would like to create (for this custom connector select the `text-davinci-003` model) and click the `Save` button 

### Save parameters
To launch this custom connector you will need following information: host, base URL and API key. Save this information for later.
1. Go to the `Overview` tab of your Azure OpenAI service and copy `Endpoint` value
![Copy Endpoint value](./assets/AzureOpenAI_HostSave.png)
2. Go to the `Keys and Endpoint` tab and copy `KEY 1` value
![Copy api-key value](./assets/AzureOpenAI_ApiKeySave.png)
3. Go to the `Model deployments` tab, select your model and click on the `Go to Azure OpenAI Studio` button
![Go to Azure OpenAI Studio](./assets/AzureOpenAI_OpenStudio.png)
In the opened window click the `Completions playground` button
![Completions playground](./assets/AzureOpenAI_Playground.png)
In the Playground click the `View code` button
![View Code](./assets/AzureOpenAI_ViewCode.png)
In the pop-up window switch to the `json` format and copy Base URL (marked in yellow on the screenshot below)
![Save Base URL](./assets/AzureOpenAI_BaseUrlSave.png)

## Minimal Path to Awesome

* Download the `.zip` from the `solution` folder
* Go to [Power Automate Studio](https://make.powerautomate.com/), go to `Solutions` and click `Import solution`
![Import solution - step 1](./assets/Import_Step1.png)
* Select the solution by clicking `Brows` button and press the `Next` button 
* Review all fields on the next screen and click `Next` button
![Import solution - step 2](./assets/Import_Step2.png)
* On the next screen provide information that you stored as prerequsines:
For the `BaseURL` field use the value that you copied from the Playground.
For the `Host` field use the value that you copied from the `Endpoint` field.
Once you are ready - click `Import` button.
